      I've been into computers for as long as I can remember. It probably
      started with video games, but what really stuck with me was the idea of
      creating my own digital experiences. That curiosity eventually grew into a
      love for building software. <button

        These days, I'm most interested in web development; the web feels like a
        massive portal where you can instantly share something you've built with
        the world. Still, I enjoy exploring all kinds of software and seeing how
        different technologies fit together.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When I want to learn something new, I just dive in and start building. I
        like creating things I can be proud of, and I try to write code that's
        clean, readable and flexible enough to grow with the project. And above
        all, I think it's important to respect the people who use what I make.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Outside of coding, I spend my time gaming, listening to music or
        watching a movie or show. I also have a habit of going down rabbit
        holes; when I find something new and interesting, I tend to dive deep
        into it, learning everything I can until I've satisfied my curiosity (or
        until something else catches my attention).
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        I'm always open to new opportunities, whether that's freelance work, an
        internship or something bigger, as long as it gives me a chance to
        learn, improve and make something useful.
